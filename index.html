            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
              My name is Aniket Mandloi, I'm 21 years old and I recently graduated from RGPV University with a Bachelors in mechanical engineering. While there, I learned a lot of theory in subjects like fluid mechanics, mechatronics, thermodynamics, machine design and more, but i was not intrested in working for core companies so i started coding to switch my career to software development. 
              I've worked hard in my education and now I'm ready to apply my knowledge into practice.
              While I don't have any real-life work experience, I've had a good exposure in Backend development. A lot of my courses involved working with real world projects.
              Now, I'm looking to leverage everything I've learned in those courses and get some hands-on work experience.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a recent college graduate, I know that what I'm lacking is career experience. However, I have used my time at university to develop many of the required skills for this job. For example, after interning in four different organizations and managing a full course load while also working at the university's admissions office, I learned how to multitask and prioritize responsibilities. From what I understand, in your fast-paced organization, the abilities to effectively prioritize tasks and work with self-discipline are significant components of success.
            </p>
